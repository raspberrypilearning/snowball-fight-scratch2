## Making a snowball

Let's make a snowball, that you can throw around your stage.

--- task ---
Open the Scratch [starter project](http://rpf.io/p/en/snowball-fight-scratch2-go){:target="_blank"} in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff){:target="_blank"}.

In the starter project, you should see a blank stage and snowball sprite ....

--- /task ---

--- task ---

The 'Snowball' sprite contains 2 costumes, a normal costume, and one that shows which direction the snowball is facing.

First, let's allow the player to change the angle of the snowball. Add this code to your snowball sprite:

![snowball sprite](images/snowball-sprite.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
wait (0.5) secs
go to x:(-200) y:(-130)
point in direction (90 v)
switch costume to [snowball-aim v]
repeat until <mouse down?>
	point towards [mouse-pointer v]
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Test out your project by clicking the green flag. You should see that your snowball follows the mouse, until you press the mouse button.

Let's also allow the player to decide on how powerful the snowball should be thrown. Create a new variable called `power`{:class="blockdata"}.

[[[generic-scratch-add-variable]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Drag your new variable display to the bottom of the stage, near the snowball. Right-click on the variable display and click 'slider'.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add code to set your new `power`{:class="blockdata"} variable to 0 when the flag is clicked.

![snowball sprite](images/snowball-sprite.png)

```blocks
when flag clicked
+ set [power v] to (0)
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now that you have a `power`{:class="blockdata"} variable, you can increase the power of the snowball _after_ the direction has been chosen with this code:

![snowball sprite](images/snowball-sprite.png)

```blocks
repeat until <mouse down?>
	point towards [mouse-pointer v]
end
+repeat until < not <mouse down?> >
	change [power v] by (1)
	wait (0.1) secs
end
```

This code means that you have to _keep the mouse button held down_ after choosing the direction, to choose the snowball's power.

Test your snowball, to see if you can choose its angle and power.
